# Discovery Service Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Records Issue
**Problem**: Duplicate opportunities were being created every time discovery was triggered due to unstable external IDs.

**Solution**: 
- **Quora Service**: Changed from timestamp-based IDs (`quora-demo-{timestamp}-{index}`) to content-based stable IDs using hash codes of question and topic
- **Blind Service**: Changed from timestamp-based IDs (`blind-demo-{timestamp}-{index}`) to content-based stable IDs using hash codes of title and content
- **Reddit Service**: Already using stable Reddit post IDs, no changes needed

### 2. Low Discovery Results Issue
**Problem**: Very few results were being returned from Reddit, Quora, and Blind sources.

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### Reddit Service Improvements:
- **Expanded Subreddit Coverage**: Increased from 11 to 40+ subreddits including:
  - Core startup/business subreddits
  - Technology and development communities
  - Industry-specific subreddits (fintech, healthtech, edtech, etc.)
  - Investment and funding communities
  - Product and growth subreddits
  - Remote work and hiring communities
  - Innovation and trend subreddits

- **Enhanced Keyword Detection**: Expanded opportunity keywords from 15 to 40+ including:
  - Funding signals (various funding stages, valuation terms)
  - Product/launch signals (beta, MVP, early access, etc.)
  - Growth signals (scaling, hiring, traction metrics)
  - Business signals (revenue metrics, exits, acquisitions)
  - Collaboration signals (co-founders, accelerators)
  - Innovation signals (disruption, breakthroughs)

- **Improved Filtering Logic**:
  - Reduced minimum engagement requirements (from 5 score/3 comments to 2 score/1 comment)
  - Lowered score threshold for relevance (from 30 to 20)
  - Fixed per-subreddit limit to ensure diversity
  - Added post-collection sorting by score

#### Quora Service Improvements:
- **Dynamic Sample Generation**: Instead of 5 hardcoded samples, now generates 25+ diverse samples covering:
  - AI/ML opportunities (3+ variations)
  - SaaS opportunities (3+ variations)
  - Fintech opportunities (3+ variations)
  - Developer tools (3+ variations)
  - Healthtech opportunities (3+ variations)
  - E-commerce/Marketplace opportunities
  - EdTech opportunities
  - Climate Tech opportunities
  - Security/Privacy opportunities
  - Remote Work tools opportunities

- **Randomization**: Samples are shuffled to provide variety across multiple discovery runs

#### Blind Service Improvements:
- **Expanded Sample Data**: Increased from 7 to 25+ diverse insider posts covering:
  - Unicorn and high-growth companies
  - Series A/B companies with strong signals
  - Early stage startups with proven teams
  - Industry disruption signals
  - Geographic expansion opportunities
  - Insider trading/acquisition signals
  - Competitive intelligence
  - Technical breakthroughs
  - Compensation insights

- **Better Categorization**: More detailed opportunity types and metadata

### 3. Additional Improvements

#### Enhanced Discovery Stats Endpoint:
- Added `/api/v1/discovery/stats` endpoint that shows:
  - Total opportunities count
  - Opportunities by source breakdown
  - Opportunities by type breakdown
  - Enabled sources list

This helps monitor the effectiveness of discovery and identify any issues with specific sources.

## How to Test

1. Ensure the application is running with `./startup-dev.sh`
2. Run the test script: `./test-discovery-improvements.sh`
3. Check the stats endpoint to verify:
   - More opportunities from each source
   - No duplicate count increases on repeated triggers

## Expected Results

- **Reddit**: Should discover 20-50+ opportunities per run from diverse subreddits
- **Quora**: Should discover 15-25 opportunities per run (limited by sample data)
- **Blind**: Should discover 15-25 opportunities per run (limited by sample data)
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Running discovery multiple times should not increase counts significantly

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real API Integration**: Replace simulated data in Quora and Blind with actual web scraping or API integration
2. **Dynamic Keyword Learning**: Use ML to identify new opportunity signals from discovered content
3. **Source Quality Scoring**: Rate sources based on the quality of opportunities they provide
4. **Duplicate Detection Enhancement**: Add fuzzy matching to catch near-duplicates with slight variations
5. **Rate Limit Optimization**: Implement adaptive rate limiting based on source response times

## Code Quality Improvements

- Added proper imports for Collections utility
- Maintained consistent coding style
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Improved code documentation with comments
- Followed Spring Boot best practices
